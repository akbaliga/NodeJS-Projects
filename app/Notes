npm install -E -D ( -E exact version, -D devDependencies)

There are dependencies that are actually used to run the application ( dependencies in package.json -- for eg: lodash)
There are other dependencies that are not part of the app but are more for development tooling ( devDependencies in package.json for eg: eslint)
So when we run npm install --production, it only installs dependencies

Use a class when you have a set of functions that you want to easily share with many objects.

which create-react-app -- shows where the command is installed on the local machine


use npm-trends to look for package options for some functionality
