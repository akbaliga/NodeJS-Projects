Exercise 1
Create a configuration file. The file should have configuration data for these two items:
port number
name of the default file, 'index.html'
When the application first runs, load the configuration (you can name the file whatever you want), and use the values from it to configure the web application

The configuration file should be stored in a JSON format.

Bonus:

Log each request to the server to a log file recording the date/time and the requested URL
